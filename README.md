GOAL: To Create a website which will help users determine if there’s a chance that the user has an irregular heart beat.

DATASET:

We will be utilizing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from the CDC during 2013 - 2014. This dataset is composed of several health metrics as well as survey data from individuals.

MODEL BUILD ON:

Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas (Data Cleaning/Wrangling)
Matplotlib (Model Visualization within Jupyter Notebook)
SciKit Learn (Machine Learning Model)
Seaborn (Statistical Analysis- Correlation Matrix)
Tableau(Data Visulization and Correlation matrix)
Flask(Running the html's & Collecting and Routing of Data)
MongoDB(For efficiency App was running on MongoDB)

WEB APPLICATION BUILD ON:

Flask
HTML
CSS (Bootstrap)
JavaScript


Programs/Methods Used to ETL Data, Build a Machine Learning Model, & Test and Train Model .
 1)Extracted data as CSV files and created final (cleaned_data.csv)
 2)Jupyter Notebooks/Pandas to clean data (remove extraneous columns, join or merge files; to produce consistent datasets) (import_merge_csv.ipynb)
 3)Continue working on .csv's and created Correlation heatmap((import_merge_csv.ipynb)
 4)Build various machine learning models to find the best one for our purpose
	a)logistic_regression model (pulse_logistic_regression.ipynb)
	b)
5)Transfered data to MongoDB(mongo_transfer.ipynb)
6)Started developing website created(homepage.html, model.html, results.html)
7)Deployed all pages using Flask(app.py)
8)Collected user data filtered and generated results(app.py)
